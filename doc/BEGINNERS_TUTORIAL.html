<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Spacemacs is a beginner-friendly and powerful extension of a popular text
editor called Emacs. To install Spacemacs you need to first install base Emacs
and then download the Spacemacs extension files, which is most easily done by
using a program called Git. The steps are easy and outlined below.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="org367e03f"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> 3. Install Spacemacs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
Open a terminal or command prompt, paste the following code to it:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Press <code>RET</code> (return / enter) to execute the code and the program you installed
in the previous step, Git, will download the Spacemacs extension files.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4b67e33" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4b67e33"><span class="section-number-4">2.3.1</span> Note for Windows users</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-1">
<p>
If you use windows, you have to modify the git command by inserting the correct
path to your .emacs.d folder. The dot before the folder means that it is hidden,
so you'll have to search for hidden files to find the folder. When you have
found the folder, substitute the original path with the correct one. The proper
code would look something like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs /path/to/your/.emacs.d

<div id="outline-container-org09d82ec" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org09d82ec"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> 4. Install the default font</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
The default font used by Spacemacs is Source Code Pro by Adobe. It is
recommended to <a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro#font-installation-instructions">install</a> it on your system to ensure correct visual
representation. Also a "Fallback font" for nicer-looking symbols in the modeline
(bottom bar) is recommended. These depend on the system:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>gnu/linux: Nanum</li>
<li>MacOS: Arial Unicode MS</li>
<li>Windows: MS Gothic or Lucida Sans Unicode</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the modeline doesn't look as great as in the pictures, make sure you have the
correct fallback font installed on your system.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org74585f6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org74585f6"><span class="section-number-3">2.5</span> 5. Open Spacemacs and choose default editing style</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
Open Spacemacs by clicking the Emacs icon in your applications menu. The first
time Spacemacs launches, it will load and install packages and prompt you for
your preferred editing style. You have two options: Vim ("Among the stars aboard
the Evil flagship") and Emacs. If you haven't used Emacs before or are unsure
about the differences of the editing styles, we recommend selecting the default,
Vim, by pressing <code>RET</code>. Using this configuration is introduced more thoroughly
in the next section. If you are already familiar with Emacs or do not plan to
switch into modal editing style, select Emacs with the left and right arrow
keys. There is also a third option, "Hybrid", for more advanced users willing to
use both styles. All of these choices can be easily changed later by editing the
dotspacemacs-editing-style variable in the dotfile (see Configuring Spacemacs),
so if modal editing does not sweep you away, you can switch to the Emacs style
later.
</p>

<p>
Next, you will be prompted for the distribution you would like to start with.
The standard distribution is recommended, press <code>RET</code> to select it.
</p>

<p>
Now Spacemacs will download and install required packages. This will take some
minutes depending on your connection. After everything is installed (you will
see the text "n packages loaded in x s" appear in the list under the Spacemacs
logo), restart Spacemacs.
</p>

<p>
Now your installation process is complete, congratulations! For troubleshooting,
see the last section.

<h3 id="orgdb28bdb"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Keybinding notation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
The power of Spacemacs lies in its efficient keybindings. Because it is built on
Emacs, we will use Emacs conventions for keybinding notation. The most important
modifier keys are:
</p>

<p>
<code>SPC</code> = <code>Space</code>, used as the leader key in Vim editing style.
<code>RET</code> = <code>Return</code> (also known as <code>Enter</code>)
<code>C-</code> = <code>Ctrl</code>
<code>M-</code> (for "meta") = <code>Alt</code>
<code>S-</code> = <code>Shift</code>
</p>

<p>
The modifier keys can be used either in a sequence or as key chords by pressing
two keys at the same time. <code>SPC 1</code> is notation for a key sequence and means
pressing <code>Space</code> first and pressing <code>1</code> after it. Key chords are notated by
writing a <code>-</code> between the keys. Thus <code>C-c</code> means pressing <code>Ctrl</code> and the letter
<code>c</code> simultaneously. Key chords and sequences can also be combined: <code>C-c a</code> means
"First press <code>Ctrl</code> and <code>c</code> simultaneously, then press <code>a</code>". <code>C-c C-a</code> means
"First press <code>Ctrl</code> and <code>c</code> simultaneously, then press <code>Ctrl</code> and <code>a</code>
simultaneously".
</p>

<p>
This document assumes you chose the "Vim" editing style and notates accordingly.
If you chose the Emacs editing style, just substitute <code>SPC</code> with <code>M-m</code> in all
the commands that begin with <code>SPC</code>.
</p>

<p>
(Note: Other modifier keys such as <code>Super</code>, notated with a small-case <code>s-</code>, can
be set up but this is rarely necessary in Spacemacs).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5aaf191" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5aaf191"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Modal text editing - why and how?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Writing (or programming) is typically not a simple linear process of adding
words and lines until finished. At least as important part of the work consists
of editing the text: deleting and rewriting parts, moving sentences around or
jumping to an earlier point to fix a discrepancy.
</p>

<p>
The crudest way to, for example, delete a certain line is moving the mouse to
the line in question, clicking on the line and then deleting it by pressing
backspace repeatedly. This is slow and inefficient, both because you have to
take your hands from your keyboard and because repeatedly pressing backspace
takes time. The more time you spend pressing keys, the more time and energy is
wasted.
</p>

<p>
To speed up editing, many editors use key chords for common editing tasks:
<code>Control-c</code> for copying and so on. However, these types of shortcuts tend to
have two problems. First, you have to press two keys at the same time, which is
harder to coordinate and thus slower than pressing keys in a sequence. Second,
you typically have to use your weakest fingers (pinkies) extensively and bend
your wrists in unergonomic positions, which is uncomfortable for many and risks
developing carpal tunnel syndrome in the long run.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, Spacemacs uses modal editing. Modal editing means that different
modes are used for editing and writing text. While this can sound complicated at
first, in practice it can be learned quickly and once learned is unparallelled
in speed and ergonomy. Our earlier example of deleting a certain line of text (a
very common edit task) can be achieved in Spacemacs by simply navigating to the
line in question with the keys <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> (navigation keys) and pressing <code>d</code>
(for "delete") two times!
</p>

<p>
You might have noticed that this was achieved entirely without moving your
fingers from your home row (the row where your fingers lie in rest when
touch-typing) and without using modifier keys.

<h3 id="orgf655770"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Start the Vim tutorial</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
The modal editing features of Spacemacs originate from a text editor called Vi,
and thus the modal editing tutorial is called eVIl tutor. Press <code>SPC h T</code> (that
is, the spacebar followed by <code>h</code> and <code>T</code>) to familiarize yourself with
modal editig.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org51f5276" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org51f5276"><span class="section-number-3">3.4</span> Using the spacebar to launch commands</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<p>
Now that you are familiar with writing and editing text it is time to put the
"Space" into Spacemacs. Because the spacebar is the most accessible key on the
keyboard and is pressed by the strongest fingers (the thumbs), it is a natural
choice for launching commands. You can think of it as the start menu of
Spacemacs.
</p>

<p>
A short instant after the spacebar is pressed a menu pops up. This interactive
menu shows you what submenus and commands can be accessed by subsequent
keypresses. Browsing around this menu is a great way of finding new features in
Spacemacs, so keep on eye on the different options! <code>ESC</code> usually breaks the
combination you don't want to use.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org507e243" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org507e243"><span class="section-number-3">3.5</span> Buffers, windows and frames</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-5">
<p>
Because Emacs (the extension of which Spacemacs is) was developed in the 80's
before the advent of modern graphical user interfaces, Emacs has
a different name of what we normally call "windows": in Emacs these are
called "frames". A frame is what pops up when you launch Spacemacs from your
desktop shortcut. A frame contains windows and buffers.
</p>

<p>
Windows are the visual spaces a frame is divided into. The default
is one, but windows can be split to allow editing multiple files in one frame.
Let's try this. Press <code>SPC</code> to bring up the menu. You can see different letters
having different submenus associated with them, usually with a mnemonic for
easier recall. The letter w is assigned for "windows": press it. A new menu
opens with further options. Write the character / to split the currently active
window vertically into two.
</p>

<p>
Now you should see two windows of this tutorial, and the one on the left should
be active, as can be seen from the modeline in the bottom or by moving the
cursor around using the navigation keys. This isn't very useful, as we
would probably want to see a different file on the right.
</p>

<p>
First, activate the window on the right with <code>SPC 2</code>. Now that the window on the
right is active, we can open a different buffer for a different file. We'll use
the scratch buffer, which can be used like a notepad. Be warned, unlike other
buffers it doesn't prompt you whether you want to save the changes you've made
when quitting the program! Press <code>SPC b</code> to open the buffers menu and then
switch to the scratch buffer by pressing s. Now you have two different buffers
in two different windows open, great! You can write something on the scratch
buffer, and when you're done, make sure that the scratch window is active and
close it by pressing <code>SPC w d</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now the tutorial window fills the whole frame. But you only closed the window,
not the scratch buffer, so the buffer is still open beneath the surface. You can
quickly switch between the current buffer and the last with <code>SPC TAB</code>: use this
a couple of times to switch between the tutorial and the scratch buffer. <code>SPC b</code>
has more options for switching between buffers, for example <code>SPC b b</code> opens a
searchable list of all currently open buffers and <code>SPC b d</code> closes the current
buffer.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-6">
<p>
Files can be accessed under the <code>SPC f</code> mnemonic. You can navigate to any file
with <code>SPC f f</code> and open it by pressing <code>RET</code>. Accessing recently opened files is
a very common task and is done with <code>SPC f r</code>. An edited file is saved with
<code>SPC f s</code>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
Spacemacs divides its configuration into self-contained units called
configuration layers. These layers are stacked on top of each other to achieve a
custom configuration.
</p>

<p>
By default Spacemacs uses a dotfile called ~/.spacemacs to control which layers
to load. Within this file you can also configure certain features. First, split
the window vertically to view both this tutorial and the dotfile simultaneously
(<code>SPC w /</code>). Open the dotfile by pressing <code>SPC f e d</code>. Navigate to the line
starting with "dotspacemacs-configuration-layers". The following lines have
further instructions: uncomment org and git layers if you want to be
familiarized with them. More <a href="../layers/LAYERS.html">layers</a> for different languages and tools can be
found by pressing <code>SPC h SPC</code>. The added layers will be installed upon restart
of Spacemacs.
</p>

<p>
Mac users: add the osx layer to use the OS X keybindings!

<h3 id="org63df0f6"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> Org mode</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
Org mode is one of the best features of Spacemacs and enough reason to warrant
its use. Org mode's official description tells that it is "for keeping notes,
maintaining todo lists, planning projects, and authoring documents with a fast
and effective plain-text system", but this gives only a small inkling of its
versatility. If you do any kind of writing at all, chances are that Org mode
will make it easier and more fun. This tutorial was written in Org mode.
</p>

<p>
Install the Org layer and open this tutorial. Make a copy named test.org with <code>SPC f c</code>
somewhere outside of the .emacs.d directory. Write <code>SPC SPC org-mode RET</code> to
switch to org mode from the write-only documentation mode.
</p>

<p>
Press <code>S-TAB</code> repeatedly and observe that this cycles the visibility of the
contents of different headlines. Press <code>t</code> in normal mode and observe that you
can add TODO tags on headlines. Press <code>M-k</code> or <code>M-j</code> in normal mode and see how
you can quickly move parts of the document around.
</p>

<p>
This is not even scratching the surface of Org mode, so you should look into
<a href="../layers/+emacs/org/README.html">org layer</a> with <code>SPC h SPC org</code> for more information. Googling for Org mode
tutorials is also very helpful in finding out the most useful features of it!

<h3 id="org8dce519"><span class="section-number-3">5.2</span> Version control - the intelligent way</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
Version control means keeping track of the changes and edits you have made to
your document. Often version control is done by saving different versions of the
document with different names, such as "document version 13" and so on. This is
crude in many ways: if you want to, for example, re-add something you deleted,
you have to manually open several past versions of the document to find the one
with the deleted part, and then copy-paste it to the most recent file. More
complicated edits will be harder still. Fortunately, there is a much better way.
Git is the most popular version control system for programmers, but it can be as
useful for people that are writing school or scientific papers, fiction or blog
posts as well.
</p>

<p>
Install the git layer, restart Spacemacs and open a file you want to version
control. You can check the status of your file by pressing <code>SPC g s</code>. Select the
folder your file is in. You will be prompted whether you want to create a
repository in the folder. Select yes. You will see a list of "Untracked files":
navigate to the file you want to track and press s to "stage changes". You might
be prompted to save the file: save it if necessary. Now the new file needs to be
commited: press c and c again. Two windows pop up: one showing the changes
you've made since the last edit (in this case, the whole document) and another
prompting for a commit message. Write "Initial commit", press ESC to exit back
to normal mode and press <code>, c</code> confirm and quit the commit
message. To abort, press <code>, a</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now you know how to make a commit. The commits are saved in
the (hidden) .git folder in the same folder the tracked file(s) are in. You can
make further commits the same way.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">
<p>
Emacs can be used in daemon mode: a daemon runs in the background and launches
clients. This way new frames launch instantly without delay. <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsAsDaemon">Emacswiki</a> tells
more about the daemon and how to set it to launch automatically on startup.

<code>SPC ?</code> shows you the keybindings in the current major mode, which is often
helpful. For troubleshooting, please refer to the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a> by pressing <code>SPC f e f</code>.
More help is found under <code>SPC h</code>, and with <code>SPC h ~SPC</code> you can access the
comprehensive Spacemacs documentation, including this tutorial and the layer
documents.

The <a href="https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs">Gitter chat</a> can be used to ask questions if the answer cannot be found in
the documentation. For a detailed review of Spacemacs' features one can also
watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrJ2YN5y27KLhd3yNs2dR8_inqtEiEweE">Spacemacs ABC series</a> by Eivind Fonn on Youtube. Some of the
keybindings have changed since the videos were uploaded but seeing someone in
action helps spot helpful tricks that would otherwise be missed.
